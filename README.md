# ToDoList

Main form
---
This form allows you (at the momemnt) to add your tasks and to delete them 
(mark them as done). The tasks are then displayed in a list on the main form.

So how it works?
---
It creates a document which holds all your data, even if you close an app.

Future
---
Through the next months I will add a second form for adding tasks, and beside
the task you will be able to add date and time. I will also change the ".doc"
file with SQLite database, since it will be more practical to get data from
and then display it on the screen.
